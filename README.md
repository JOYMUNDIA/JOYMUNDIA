## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a unique blend of technical depth and human-centered design — drawing from a background in **Human Biology**, **Software Engineering**, and **Data Analysis**. From building responsive front-ends to designing RESTful APIs and deploying secure backend systems, I love turning complex problems into impactful digital solutions.

Currently, I’m developing **Contra-dictionary**, a health-focused web app to track food and drug contraindications — bridging the gap between tech and preventive healthcare.

I’ve also taught programming and software engineering at the tertiary level, mentored learners, and contributed to impactful community projects across health and education.
